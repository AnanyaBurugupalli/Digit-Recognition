# Digit-Recognition
# 🔢 Handwritten Digit Recognition

A machine learning project for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and classification models.

## 📌 Objective

To build a classifier that can accurately recognize and classify digits (0–9) from images using supervised learning techniques.

## 📁 Dataset

- **MNIST**: A widely used dataset of 28x28 grayscale handwritten digit images (60,000 training and 10,000 test samples).

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Normalize pixel values

2. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

The models were tested for classification accuracy. SVM and KNN typically yield high accuracy for digit classification.
